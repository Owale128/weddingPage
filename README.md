# My first next.js app - Wedding page! ðŸ˜ƒ

This project is a wedding website built with Next.js. The homepage welcomes visitors with information about the wedding date and location. Guests can RSVP through a simple form, and the information is stored in postgres database using Supabase. The navigation menu makes it easy to move between pages. Styles are managed with SCSS and the backend uses Next.js API routes to handle RSVP data.

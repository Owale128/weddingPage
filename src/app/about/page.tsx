      <p>
            We started as two lonely souls, each navigating the world alone,
            But fate brought us together, and our hearts became one.
            Through laughter and tears, we've built our life's tale,
            Every step together has filled our days with joy without fail.

            We've learned to support each other, to grow and to dream,
            Our love has grown stronger with each passing day, a perpetual stream.
            Now here we stand, ready to promise each other eternal fidelity and happiness,
            A love story written in the stars, for us two, forever.
      </p>
